We&rsquo;re building an inclusive place for LGBTQ&plus; gamers and creators. [And we&rsquo;d love you to join.](https://www.criticalchicken.com/webring)

## The widget

Our widget displays member sites&rsquo; mini-banners, smoothly scrolling, in a random order.

- It comes in two flavours: a [vibrant](https://www.criticalchicken.com/gp_iframe/vibrant.php), Pride-themed one; and a more businesslike [monochrome](https://www.criticalchicken.com/gp_iframe/monochrome.php) one.
- It&rsquo;s designed to live in an HTML `iframe`, so we made sure it&rsquo;s good at squeezing into tight spaces.
- It reacts to users&rsquo; light- and dark-mode preferences.
- If a user has turned on the &ldquo;Reduce animations&rdquo; accessibility feature on their device, the widget stays still.
  - The same goes for users who&rsquo;ve disabled JavaScript in their web browsers.
  - We also offer [static vibrant](https://www.criticalchicken.com/gp_iframe/vibrant_static.php) and [static monochrome](https://www.criticalchicken.com/gp_iframe/monochrome_static.php) variants, for websites where animation just wouldn&rsquo;t look right.
- And there are no analytics, trackers, ads, or cookies involved, which is nice.
 
## Setting up the widget

Simply choose your preferred variant, and copy and paste the HTML code. Change the `width` value if you need to &ndash; but wider is better!
